# sentiment_analysis_nlp

Developed a sentiment analysis model for Persian news using LSTM. Collected and 
preprocessed data using a web scraper (Selenium & BeautifulSoup) to extract news articles 
from yjc.ir. Utilized Hazm for text preprocessing, including tokenization, normalization, and 
stemming, to improve model performance and accuracy.
